Hi, I'm Eyob Sayebo. I'm a senior-year student with a strong background in Web Development, System Engineering, and Business Intelligence Development. As an intern at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, I enhanced UI/UX and developed REST APIs. At Dunatek Data Intelligence, I created data-driven solutions and maintained dashboards, and at SBP LLC, I designed and tested RF systems. My skills include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Python, MySQL, MongoDB, Power BI, and Tableau. I'm currently expanding my expertise as a Frontend Engineer. Feel free to explore my projects and get in touch via eyobayele54@gmail.com
